Welcome to my personal website! 

My name is Yuxin Zhu. I also go by Daisy and my Chinese name is [Á•ùÈõ®È¶®](https://www.name-coach.com/yuxin-zhu-15d331b8-8dc2-4c44-8206-ef685ebf2bdb). I am a primary faculty member of [the Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/armstrong_institute/index.html) at Johns Hopkins, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Neurology at [Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som/), and I am jointly appointed in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics) at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.


My research focuses on developing statistical methods for biomarkers and electronic medical records. I work on methods that combine biomarkers to predict cognitive decline related to preclinical Alzheimer's Disease among normal individuals. I also develop methods to evaluate misdiagnosis-related harm at institution or medical system levels using electronic medical records. 

Methodologically, I work on tree-based models, latent variable models, survival analysis, and recurrent event analysis. My general interest is in interpretable and robust statistical methodology that advances biomedical understanding and informs practices.

Look to the left (or up if you are on your phone) to learn more about me. I am looking for students to work on exciting projects with me‚Äîfeel free to shoot me an email to talk about potential projects or just to chat.
