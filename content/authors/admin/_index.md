Welcome to my personal website! 



Nelson Bighetti is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. His research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. He leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks.

My research focuses on developing statistical methods for biomarkers and electronic medical records. I work on methods that combine biomarkers to predict cognitive decline related to preclinical Alzheimer's Disease among normal individuals. I also develop methods to evaluate misdiagnosis-related harm at institution or medical system levels using electronic medical records. Methodologically, I work on tree-based models, latent variable models, survival analysis, and recurrent event analysis. My general interest is in interpretable and robust statistical methodology that advances biomedical understanding and informs practices.
