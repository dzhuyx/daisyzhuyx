THIS SITE IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION. INFORMAIOTN MAY BE INACCURATE.

Welcome to my personal website! 

My name is Yuxin Zhu. I also go by Daisy and my Chinese name is Á•ùÈõ®È¶® (reads: jooh eooh shee-eeng, according to nameshouts.com at least). I am a postdoctoral fellow jointly in the [Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://www.rits.onc.jhmi.edu/dbb/) and the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). I got my PhD in 2018 in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University under the supervision of [Dr. Mei-Cheng Wang](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~mcwang/), and I am currently jointly advised by [Dr. Zheyu Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/wangzylab/home) and [Dr. Mei-Cheng Wang](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~mcwang/).

Starting in July 2021, I will be an Acting Assistant Professor (pending appointment) in the Department of Neurology at [Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som/) and a primary faculty member of the [Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/armstrong_institute/index.html) at Johns Hopkins.

My research focuses on developing statistical methods for biomarkers and electronic medical records. I work on methods that combine biomarkers to predict cognitive decline related to preclinical Alzheimer's Disease among normal individuals. I also develop methods to evaluate misdiagnosis-related harm at institution or medical system levels using electronic medical records. Methodologically, I work on tree-based models, latent variable models, survival analysis, and recurrent event analysis. My general interest is in interpretable and robust statistical methodology that advances biomedical understanding and informs practices.
